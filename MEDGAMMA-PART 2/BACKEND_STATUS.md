**Backend Started**

I have started the `backend.py` server. It is now running and using the **synthetic patient dataset** (P001, P002, P003) exclusively.

Verify it's working by opening:
[http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/patients](http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/patients)

**Note:**
The Gemini API free tier quota (20 calls/day) might be exceeded. The backend will return structured errors if this happens, rather than fallback responses.
(Do not change any code, thisis a question).
